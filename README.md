# Data-Augmented and Retrieval-Augmented Context Enrichment in Chinese Media Bias Detection
This repository contains the dataset presented in the [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3765898) "Data-Augmented and Retrieval-Augmented Context Enrichment in Chinese Media Bias Detection". 


# Overview
This dataset contains 300 Chinese news articles (100 sets) related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These articles are labeled at both the sentence-level and the token-level. We base our work on the bias structure that contains **lexical bias** and **informational bias**, and we go one step further to craft 4 fine-grained labels in lexical bias (Exaggeration, Stereotype, Ventriloquism, and Opinion) and 3 fine-grained labels in informational bias (Omission, Framing, and Sensationalist).
